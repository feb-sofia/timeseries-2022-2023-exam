# Timeseries Analysis 2022/2023 Final Project

This is the repository where you'll find your project assignment. It also serves as the repository where you'll upload your solution. The repository is initially empty, this is normal. I'll upload your team's assignment once all teams are registered. You'll receive an email from github when your assignment is available. If you don't receive a notice until 26.01.2022 then something has gone wrong and you should contact me: boyko.amarov@gmail.com.
